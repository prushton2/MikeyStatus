### WARNINGS
* This plugin is against Discord's Terms of Service, just like BetterDiscord. Use at your own discretion.
* You getting banned for use of this isnt my fault.
* Do not spam the on/off switch on the plugin too much.
  * This causes Discord to block your IP because you look like a bot after making too many requests to change your status.
